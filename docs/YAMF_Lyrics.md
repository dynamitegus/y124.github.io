# you are my flower english cover lyrics

留心腳步 看得清楚
see your steps here you'll see clear

有很多可疑的因素
suspicious factors appear

呼喊妳　讓妳糊塗
call you to confuse you here

考驗我愛的程度
test my love is sincere

高樓電梯　霓虹深處
High elevator neon grows brighter

舞動在人群很拘束
dancing's restrained as the crowd's here

拉著我　不要飄走
hold to me keep staying near

我在妳背後擋風
keep the wind at your rear

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要擁有妳　插在我心窩
i want you to stay, this place in my heart

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要保護妳　一路都暢通
I will protect you 'till end of the road

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

就算妳身邊　很多小石頭
though there's many stones that are surrounding you

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要愛著妳　不眠也不休
I want to love you never sleep or rest

樓電梯　霓虹深處
High elevator neon grows brighter 

舞動在人群很拘束
dancing's restrained as the crowd's here

拉著我　不要飄走
hold to me keep staying near

我在妳背後擋風
keep the wind at your rear

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要擁有妳　插在我心窩
i want you to stay, this place in my heart

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要保護妳　一路都暢通
I will protect you 'till end of the road

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

就算妳身邊　很多小石頭
though there's many stones that are surrounding you

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要愛著妳　不眠也不休
I want to love you never sleep or rest

不管妳心充滿多少困惑
no matter how much your heart's confused

我絕對不會　對愛妳放鬆
i won't ever stop my great love for you

妳是我所有快樂源頭
you begin all of my happyness

我和妳將會　到達那開心樂園
yourself with myself will soon reach the wonderland

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要擁有妳　插在我心窩
i want you to stay, this place in my heart

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要保護妳　一路都暢通
I will protect you 'till end of the road

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

就算妳身邊　很多小石頭
though there's many stones that are surrounding you

喔～　妳是我的花朵
Oh~　You remain my flower

我要愛著妳　不眠也不休
I want to love you never sleep or rest
