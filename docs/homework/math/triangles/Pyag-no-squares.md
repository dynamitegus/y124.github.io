# Pythagorean theorem
## proof for equalateral trianges
the formular for equalateral triangle is `b*h/2`

the formular for a square can be `b*h`

`(b*h + b*h) = 2(b*h/2 + b*h/2)`

so `(a^2)/2 + (b^2)/2 = (c^2)/2`

for 6, 12, 13

**With Squares**

`5*5 + 12*12 = 13*13`

`25 + 144 = 169`

`root(169) = 13`

**Equalateral Triangle**

`5*5/2 + 12*12/2 = 13*13/2`

`12.5 + 72 = 84.5`

`84.5 * 2 = 169`

`root(169) = 12`
## for Octagon
the formular for an octagon is `2*(1+root(2))*a^2`

if you use the formular for an octagon as a replacement for square you get:

`2*(1+root(2))*a^2 + 2*(1+root(2))*b^2 = 2*(1+root(2))*c^2`

divide both sides by 2

`(1+root(2))*a^2 + (1+root(2))*a^2 = (1+root(2))*c^2`

divide both by `1 + root(2)`

`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

The formular for a square!
