# English Journal Prompts

### Prompt 1 Using evidence from the text, explore the complexity of Artie and Vladek’s relationship. You may want to explore how Art’s understanding of his father evolves over the course of the novel.
Artie and Vladik tolerate and even like each other but do not understand each others views on the world.

Vladik did not understanding Artie's passion for art and Artie did not understand how cheap Vladik was.

*'One reason I became an artist was that he thought it was impractical — just a waste of time … it was an area where I wouldn’t have to compete with him.'* - Art

*'But i'm no good at fixing that kind of stuff. Why don't you HIRE somebody?'* - Art

Artie and Vladik tolerate each other but have contasting values.

### Prompt 2 Is Vladek responsible for his own survival or are there other factors at work outside of his control?  Discuss.
it is my belief that both resourcefulness and luck contributed greatly to vladiks survival.

page 72 vladik survives because he sneeks in a building this is resourcefulness because he could sneek into a building before he was found.

but just 2 pages later on page 74 he survives because of the luck that his friend was there to save him.

you could argue that on page 72 he survives due to the luck of not being noticed immediately by the soldiers and on page 74 he survives due to the resourcfulness of having such a friend but i would say they both have factors of luck and resorcefulness.

page 103 he survives due to the resourcfulness of making a bunker but it was also good luck that that the cellar was there in the first place to use for the bunker.

i believe vladik required both resourcful and luck to survive
### Prompt 5 Does a hero need to be a likeable person?
it is my strong belief that a hero definitely does not need to be likeable person.

according to Collins Dictionary *"If you describe someone as your hero, you mean that you admire them a great deal, usually because of a particular quality or skill that they have."*

you can admire someone for being great at a sport and aspire to be as good as them but this does not make them a likeable person.

hero is also defined as *"the principal male character in a novel, play, etc"* there are many books and shows where the male protangist is not likeable therefore a hero is not always likeable.

heros are not always likeable.
