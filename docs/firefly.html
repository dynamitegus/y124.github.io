Lyrics:
(Open up phone)
(Fingerprint Unlock)
(Screen. Light. On. Now)

I would not believe my eyes
If new task on firefly
Lit up my screen so i can't sleep (can't fall a sleep)

Because it would make me stare
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and swear

I'd like to make myself believe
That English is due Thursday
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (yeah)

'Cause I found a Wiki stub (and)
Five sites, substantial bugs
Just to try to research for my plan (assessed)

It all went above my head
Want to hide beneath my bed
My consciousness is just hanging by a thread (stay awake)

I'd like to make myself believe
That Math is due Thursday
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall asleep) (can't fall asleep)

Leave the task overdue not slack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an absolute lack
Please take me away from here
Why must i do this not sleep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too busy to fall asleep

To 10 tasks on firefly
Why don't you say your goodbyes
I got burning eyes as tasks never farewell (please just farewell)

Well I know where several are
In my humanities sidebar 
'Cause I've done so few and now they're overdue by far (2 weeks)

I'd like to make myself believe
That Media is due Thursday
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall a sleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That all of it is due Thursday
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall a sleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That all of it is due Thursday
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (or so it seems)</p>
