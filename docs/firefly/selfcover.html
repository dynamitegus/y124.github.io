Lyrics:<br> 
(Open up phone)<br> 
(Fingerprint Unlock)<br> 
(Screen. Light. On. Now)<br> 
    <br>         
I would not believe my eyes<br> 
If new task on firefly<br> 
Lit up my screen so i can't sleep (can't fall a sleep)<br> 
<br> 
Because it would make me stare<br> 
And leave teardrops everywhere<br> 
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and swear<br> 
<br> 
I'd like to make myself believe<br> 
That English is due Thursday<br> 
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br> 
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (yeah)<br> 
<br> 
'Cause I found a Wiki stub (and)<br> 
Five sites, substantial bugs<br> 
Just to try to research for my plan (assessed)<br> 
<br> 
It all went above my head<br> 
Want to hide beneath my bed<br> 
My consciousness is just hanging by a thread (stay awake)<br> 
<br> 
I'd like to make myself believe<br> 
That Math is due Thursday<br> 
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br> 
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall asleep) (can't fall asleep)<br> 
<br> 
Leave the task overdue not slack<br> 
Please take me away from here<br> 
'Cause I feel like such an absolute lack<br> 
Please take me away from here<br> 
Why must i do this not sleep<br> 
Please take me away from here<br> 
When I'm far too busy to fall asleep<br> 
<br> 
To 10 tasks on firefly<br> 
Why don't you say your goodbyes<br> 
I got burning eyes as tasks never farewell (please just farewell)<br> 
<br> 
Well I know where several are<br> 
In my humanities sidebar <br>
'Cause I've done so few and now they're overdue by far (2 weeks)<br> 
<br> 
I'd like to make myself believe<br> 
That Media is due Thursday<br> 
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br> 
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall a sleep)<br> 
<br> 
I'd like to make myself believe<br> 
That all of it is due Thursday<br> 
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br> 
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (I can't fall a sleep)<br> 
<br> 
I'd like to make myself believe<br> 
That all of it is due Thursday<br> 
It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br> 
'Cause homework is always awful it seems (or so it seems)<br>
